# Explanation of the Week 2 Directory Structure

The **Week 2** folder in our challenge is organized to reflect both the theoretical foundations and practical coding exercises. Here's how it's structured:

## 1. Day 0 - Theory Concepts  
This subfolder covers the foundational theory essential for understanding string operations. It includes topics like:  
- **Substrings**: Different ways of extracting continuous sequences of characters.  
- **Subsequences**: Non-contiguous sequences maintaining the relative order.  
- **Anagrams**: Reordering characters to form another word or phrase.  
- **String Matching**: Techniques for finding patterns within strings.  

These concepts set the stage for the coding exercises that follow.

## 2. Day 1 - Actual Coding (Renamed)  
Since the theoretical part is foundational, we begin our hands-on coding from what we call **"Day 1 of Actual Coding."** This subfolder contains:  
- **Problem Statements**: A list of string-related challenges to apply the concepts learned.  
- **Solutions**: Well-documented solutions with step-by-step explanations.  
- **Test Cases**: Sample inputs and expected outputs for thorough validation.

This structure ensures a seamless transition from theory to practice, providing a robust learning experience and enabling a deeper understanding of string manipulation concepts.
