## 🗂️ Folder Structure

The repository is divided into folders based on weeks. Here's the structure:

```plaintext
📁 Week 1/
   ├── Day 1/
   ├── Day 2/
   ├── ...
Each folder contains solutions to the problems tackled on that specific day.

### 🛠️ How We Solve Problems
- Understand the Problem: Carefully read and analyze the problem statement.
- Plan the Solution: Think of the most efficient algorithm.
- Code the Solution: Implement the algorithm in your preferred programming language.
- Optimize and Review: Ensure the solution is optimal and meets all edge cases.
- Upload to Repository: Push the code to this repo.

### 🏆 Goals of the Challenge
- Consistency: Solve at least one DSA problem every day for 30 days.
- Improvement: Strengthen problem-solving skills.
- Learning: Explore foundational data structures and algorithms.
- Sharing: Maintain a record of our journey and help others learn.
